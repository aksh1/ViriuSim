# ViruSim
Simulating the spread of a mathematically produced disease across chunks.

Technological Aspects
Our code uses 3D data structures to precisely model and store data from diseases. Our algorithims take into account a numerous amount of factors ranging from travel, interaction, and infection rates. Our visual representations put into perspective how dangerous a disease can be and can eduacte the world during this time of crisis, now more than ever.

## Why?
During this crisis, it is critical everyone understands that this is real, and not something out of a comic book. We hope our program can not only inform but educate around the world.

## Prerequisites
Java 14

## Installing
Navigate to releases, and download and run the jar file.

## Running
To run, use the "main" method in the "Runner" class. You can modify the "disease.ini" configuration file to set the parameters of the simulation. (More info explaining the parameters are in the configuration file.)

## Troubleshooting
The code and UI are still in development. If you encounter problems, feel free to contact us!

## Built With
